As a bitcoin day trader, I want a full-screen live chart of the price so I can
keep an eye on it at all times.  It would be even better if it popped up
whenever I plugged my device in.

I'm waiting for a good price before I buy my bitcoins.  A notification when the
price drops below a certain point would be helpful.

I like to keep a subconscious eye on the bitcoin price.  Homescreen widgets
with price numbers or recent charts help me do that without thinking about it
too much.

I don't trade every day, but I use bitcoin as a mid to long term investment
vehicle.  Simple statistical reports on bitcoin over the last day, week, and
month would help me make informed decisions.

I'm curious about bitcoin and enjoy following it loosely.  A quick and simple
price viewing program is all I need.
